# Processing absorption spectra

A set of simple scripts for processing optical measurements with a single absorption peak.

This repository contains scripts for:
* A single optical spectrum
* Comparing a set of spectra directly
* Finding and saving the peak minimum in a folder of .csv spectra
* Plotting these peak wavelengths
* Calculating the noise variation (3&sigma;) in the fitted peak wavelengths

These scripts aim to be [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).
